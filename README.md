## Overview

This application allows you to easily install a custom Web application, providing files access with [SFTP](https://yunohost.org/en/filezilla).

It can also create a MySQL or PostgreSQL database - which will be backed up and restored with your application. The connection details will be stored in the file `db_access.txt` located in the root directory.

PHP-FPM version can also be selected among `none`, `7.4`, `8.0`, `8.1` and `8.2`.

**Once installed, go to the chosen URL to know the user, domain and port you will have to use for the SFTP access.** The password is one you chosen during the installation. Under the Web directory, you will see a `www` folder which contains the public files served by this app. You can put all the files of your custom Web application inside.

You can also customize 404 errors - if you enable the option in the config panel. Simply create an `error` folder in the `www` root directory, containing your custom `html` files. 


**Shipped version:** 1.0~ynh19
